# Slice_JS_Pizza_Menu_Drill
This is my final project for the JavaScript course at the Tech Academy. In this assignment
I created a website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.  The basic requirements included:
Creating a menu with buttons, (radio, checkbox, order) and tables to present a menu to patrons.
Using JavaScript, we were required to create an itemized invoiced receipt that accurately calculated
and displayed the users order.

The biggest challenge I faced for this assignment was determining where to begin.  I decided to break the assignment down into smaller parts and began to research how to code for
each task at hand.  I learned how to write functions, for loops, conditional statements, assign variables, and create arrays. I also gained further knowledge about how to find answers to technical questions online.
